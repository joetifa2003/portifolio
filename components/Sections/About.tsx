I started learning programming when I was just 12! I frist learned C# and SQL Server which was a bit difficult but it was a great expreince and I learned alot about programming. Then I started to learn multiple other languages like Java, Python, Ruby, Dart(Flutter) and I really had fun doing it! And i kept learning, Making scripts, And building multiple projects that gave me more experince.

My interset in web development started back in 2019 when I decided to learn more about web design and backend development.

Fast-forward to today, and Iâ€™ve learned alot about web devolepment and I fall in love with javascript!`
